Salmon populations are vital to the **economic, cultural, and ecological health** of British Columbia. However, habitat fragmentation, dam construction, and environmental degradation threaten their ability to migrate and spawn. This research applies **GIS and remote sensing** to assess salmon habitat accessibility and develop conservation strategies.

## Why This Research Matters

-   **Salmon as a Keystone Species**: Salmon support entire ecosystems, providing nutrients for forests and food for wildlife.
-   **Threats to Migration Routes**: Dams and habitat fragmentation reduce access to critical spawning grounds.
-   **Scientific Approach to Conservation**: Remote sensing and GIS allow for large-scale habitat assessment, identifying high-risk areas and informing policy decisions.

# Methodology & Tools

## Tools and Technologies Used

This project leverages **remote sensing, GIS analysis, and hydrological modeling** to map stream networks and assess habitat accessibility.

-   **Digital Elevation Models (DEM)**: Used to derive hydrology layers and stream networks.
-   **ArcGIS Pro**: Hydrology and Network Analyst toolsets for modeling salmon migration paths.
-   **LiDAR Data**: Enhances DEM resolution for more precise stream delineation.
-   **Flow Accumulation Models**: Simulates water movement and stream formation.
-   **Network Analysis**: Identifies barriers such as dams and models accessible salmon routes.

# Study Area

## Vancouver Island â€“ A Critical Salmon Habitat

The study focuses on **Vancouver Island, British Columbia**, a region with a rich network of salmon-bearing streams and lakes.

### Key Features:

-   **Over 24,000 stream segments analyzed**.
-   **Dams mapped as potential barriers** to migration.
-   **Major lakes and tributaries assessed** for connectivity to the ocean.

### Fire & Industrial Threats

-   **Hydroelectric Dams**: Alter natural flow patterns, affecting migration routes.
-   **Forestry & Land Use Changes**: Increased sedimentation can degrade spawning habitat.
-   **Climate Change**: Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns threaten freshwater ecosystems.

# Key Findings

## **Salmon Habitat Accessibility**

-   **5,984 stream segments are inaccessible** due to lack of ocean connectivity or dam obstructions.
-   **18,419 stream segments remain accessible**, representing key spawning areas.

## **The Role of DEM Resolution**

-   **25m DEM captures major drainage patterns** but lacks finer details for smaller tributaries.
-   **Higher-resolution (5m) DEMs could improve accuracy**, but introduce computational challenges.

## **The Impact of Dams on Migration**

-   Critical **stream segments are fragmented**, potentially isolating salmon populations.
-   **Larger lakes with ocean connections should be prioritized** for conservation efforts.

## **Recommendations for Conservation**

1.  **Prioritize dam removal or fish passage solutions** in high-impact areas.
2.  **Expand protected Riparian Management Areas (RMAs)** to reduce sedimentation.
3.  **Incorporate additional habitat factors** (e.g., water quality, seasonal changes) into future models.

# GIS & Remote Sensing Visualizations

## Remote Sensing for Habitat Assessment

Using satellite imagery and LiDAR, we can assess: - **Water depth and velocity** to determine suitable spawning locations. - **Stream sedimentation patterns** to identify pollution sources. - **Forest cover changes** to monitor riparian habitat health.

1.  **DEM Processing**:
    -   Generate hydrology layers from a 25m DEM.
    -   Identify flow direction and accumulation patterns.
2.  **Stream Network Analysis**:
    -   Classify streams based on **stream order, slope, and accessibility**.
    -   Compare DEM-derived streams to **base map** data.
3.  **Barrier Identification**:
    -   Map dams as barriers and determine their impact on connectivity.
    -   Calculate how much stream length remains accessible to salmon.
4.  **Habitat Suitability Modeling**:
    -   Evaluate conditions such as **water depth, quality, and flow velocity**.
    -   Use remote sensing data to detect potential spawning areas.
