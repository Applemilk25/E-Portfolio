    "text": "Why This Research Matters\nWildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change, endangering communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure. Traditional wildfire risk mapping methods rely on expert interpretation and aerial photography, leading to significant classification errors. Our research integrates LiDAR technology to enhance wildfire fuel type classification, offering: - More accurate fire behavior predictions through high-resolution fuel maps. - Improved wildfire response and mitigation strategies. - Better-informed forest management and policy decisions to reduce risk in high-priority areas.\nBy improving the precision of VRI fuel type classification, this research contributes directly to wildfire prevention, preparedness, and suppression efforts, ultimately protecting lives, property, and biodiversity."
