# Wildfire Management

This research integrates **LiDAR-based metrics into wildfire fuel classification** to improve accuracy and enhance wildfire management strategies. By refining fuel type classification, this project directly supports:

\- **More effective wildfire risk assessments** for emergency response teams.

\- **Better land management policies** to reduce fire hazards.

\- **Enhanced resource allocation** for fire suppression efforts.

## Why This Research Matters

Wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change, endangering communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure. Traditional wildfire risk mapping methods rely on expert interpretation and aerial photography, leading to significant classification errors. Our research integrates LiDAR technology to enhance wildfire fuel type classification, offering: - **More accurate fire behavior predictions** through high-resolution fuel maps. - **Improved wildfire response and mitigation** strategies. - **Better-informed forest management and policy decisions** to reduce risk in high-priority areas.

By improving the precision of VRI fuel type classification, this research contributes directly to wildfire prevention, preparedness, and suppression efforts, ultimately protecting lives, property, and biodiversity.

## Research Objectives

-   Enhance **VRI fuel type classification** with LiDAR data.
-   Identify **spatial patterns in forest fuel distribution**.
-   Improve wildfire management through more accurate **fuel type mapping**.
-   Validate the effectiveness of LiDAR augmentation using comparative analysis.

# Methodology & Results

## Fuel Type Classification

We utilized the **BCWS fuel typing algorithm**, integrating LiDAR-derived metrics to improve traditional VRI classifications.

### **Key Steps in Methodology**

1.  **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**
    -   Processed **point cloud LiDAR data** using the `lidR` package in R.
    -   **Removed noise, duplicates, and outliers**.
    -   Converted the dataset to **EPSG:26910** (NAD83 / UTM zone 10N).
2.  **Terrain Normalization & CHM Generation**
    -   Created a **2m resolution Digital Terrain Model (DTM)**.
    -   Generated a **Canopy Height Model (CHM)**.
    -   Filtered vegetation **below 2m** to remove understory noise.
3.  **Tree Detection & Feature Extraction**
    -   Used a **local maximum filter (LMF, 5m window)** for tree detection.
    -   Extracted the following **tree metrics**:
        -   **Tree Height**
        -   **Canopy Area**
        -   **Aspect Ratio** (height to width)
        -   **Canopy Curvature** (surface curvature measurement)
    -   Integrated LiDAR-derived tree attributes into an enhanced **VRI dataset**.
4.  **Augmenting VRI Fuel Types**
    -   Applied the **Canadian Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System** fuel classification.
    -   Mapped **conifer percentage across RMOW**.
    -   Created a **geodatabase** for wildfire risk assessment.

### **Challenges & Limitations**

-   Lack of ground-truth validation data.
-   Potential misclassification in open-canopy conifer stands.
-   Computational complexity of tree segmentation.

We can see that trees that are more expose to unforested areas tend to be shorter Figure 3. plots our detected trees and colored them based on their canopy area, showing its distribution across our sample plot.

We know that popular deciduous trees within BC are Bigleaf Maple, and Black cottonwood and their aspect ratios frequently average between 1.29 - 2.39 while coniferous trees such as Douglas fir and Western Redceder range from 2.84 to 4.25 according to BC BigTree Statistics from UBC Faculty of Forestry (2025). Higer aspect ratio means that a tree is more narrow and is more likely to be a conifer.](images/plot_AR.png)

## Enhancing VRI Accuracy

Traditional VRI classification relies on expert interpretation and aerial photography. Our LiDAR-augmented method provides:

-   **Higher Resolution Mapping**: More detailed tree and canopy detection.
-   **Improved Classification Accuracy**: Enhanced fuel type differentiation.
-   **Revised VRI Maps**: Correcting classification errors (e.g., misclassified C-5 fuel types).
